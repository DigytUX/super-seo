## What is Super SEO?
Super SEO is a next JS template that is configured for dynamic SEO content right out of the box! Currently it only uses Wordpress's API but will later on add branches to service other CMSs.

### Why Super SEO
- Straight to the point SEO configuration based on content meta
- Headless Friendly (Built once and run anywhere)
- Dynamic, content is automatically updated with seo preconfigured
- Dynamic sitemap (no need to manually add urls)
- Enhances search engine rankings
- More customers and web traffic
- Higher conversions
- More trust, reviews and return patreons/patients/clients...etc
- 
### Features

#### Robots.txt
The robots.txt file is a text file that tells web robots (most often search engines) which pages on your site to crawl and which not to crawl. It is a way to give web robots instructions for how to crawl your site.


#### Sitemap.xml
A sitemap is a file that lists all the pages on your website. It helps search engines discover and crawl the pages on your site. The sitemap is typically written in XML format and can be submitted to search engines through their webmaster tools or directly in the robots.txt file.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
